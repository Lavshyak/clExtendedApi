library to simplify working with opencl c++ sdk and some opencl kernel helpers. opencl 2.2, CL_HPP_ENABLE_EXCEPTIONS.

The Cmakelists.txt is almost finished and has build errors, customize it yourself, I'm tired, I'm leaving for c#.

Tested on windows 10, MinGW, Ninja. https://github.com/KhronosGroup/OpenCL-SDK/releases/tag/v2023.04.17
